Math Interoperability Types.

This library provides standard mathematical types types used in computer graphics.
It's only purpose is to serve as a standard and interoperability language between various components of rust-gamedev ecosystem that happen to expose math-related types on their API.
There are no operations defined for the types other than for the means of conversion from/into external types.
